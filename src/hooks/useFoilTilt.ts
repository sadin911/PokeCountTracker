/**
 * 3D tilt for premium (foil-only) cards, driven by the pointer on a desktop and
 * by the device gyroscope on a phone.
 *
 * Both inputs hold their angle. A pointer says where you are looking, so the card
 * stays leaned while the cursor sits on it; a gyroscope says how the phone is
 * being held, so the card stays leaned until the phone is levelled again. Neither
 * springs back on its own.
 *
 * What sells the illusion is not the rotation on its own — it is that the
 * specular highlight and the holographic bands move *against* the tilt, the way
 * light does on a real foil card. So this hook publishes both: the rotation, and
 * the position the CSS uses to place the highlight.
 *
 * One hook owns every `--foil-*` property on the element. Pointer and gyro are
 * gated on mutually exclusive media queries, but routing both through a single
 * writer means there is no arrangement in which two sources fight over the same
 * variable.
 *
 * Everything is written straight to CSS custom properties rather than to React
 * state. A grid can hold sixty of these, and re-rendering a card on every
 * pointermove would be the one thing guaranteed to make it feel cheap.
